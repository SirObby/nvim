# My NeoVim Config

## Master branch
This neovim config works on the Neovim Master branch or (development) versions, although with *some* minor issues. \
(2 plugins show nil on boot)

## Installation:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
Inside NeoVim:
```
:PackerInstall
```

There are some dependencies, but idk them.

## Problems

For some reason Formatting doesn't work, as in I can't format my code for indenting and stuff.\
So if you can do that somehow, you can Pull Request.
